See ScannerComs component for how to use the scanner coms.  This ScannerComsConnect component only connects to the scanner (which needs to happen before any of the ScannerComs can work fully).

The default settings should work for the MNC scanner this was developed for.  The mock scanner annoyingly might be a different port I think.
