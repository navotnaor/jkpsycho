A component that supports arbitrary text responses from participants.  They can type whatever they want, symbols, capitalizations, etc.  Even multiple lines, if so enabled.  Note, pressing return won't automatically finalize the input and/or stop the routine.  You should use a keyboard component for that.  As with most components, you can stop this one whenever you want by running the statement "<Name>.status=STOPPED".

The text is available in the variable "<Name>.text", where <Name> should be replaced by whatever
you name this component.  By default, "text_response.text" is where the text goes.
