A component that makes it easy to read a spreadsheet row by row.  Trial and Block loops in PsychoPy require that the entire spreadsheet is read through, which isn't always desirable.  Maybe you want to go through the entire spreadsheet only once over the course of multiple blocks (each block containing multiple trials)?  By using this component instead, you will have access to the next row of the table every time the given routine starts.

Use the 'var_name' setting to define how the current row should be accessed. Say you have a spreadsheet with column names like 'color' and 'size'.  If you set var_name='trial', then you can get the current trial's color with 'trial.color'.  Note: this is slightly different than how PsychoPy does it with its looped spreadsheets... PsychoPy would just have a variable named 'color' floating about.  My way is more robust, say if you wanted to loop through multiple spreadsheets at the same time and sometimes the column names conflicted...
